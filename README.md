# ax25-packet-network
AX.25 Packet Network is a repository designed as an introduction to develop a Packet Network based on the AX.25 Protocols within the Linux Kernel.

AX.25 Protocol is available to be used by everyone and can be installed by using the following commands:
```
# apt-get install libax25
# apt-get install libax25-dev
# apt-get install ax25-apps
# apt-get install ax25-tools
```

AX.25 Packet Network can be built by a Radio, a Modem, and a Linux Computer (Raspberry Pi works too). Basic knowledges needed to develop an AX.25 Packet Network is UNIX Network Programming, Socket Programming, AVR Programming in C (Arduino also works), and Hardware Prototyping which includes but not limited to Audio Frequency and Radio Frequency Analog Electronics.

This repository contains documentation of simple program to implement AX.25 program within Linux kernel to control basic information exchange via AX.25.
